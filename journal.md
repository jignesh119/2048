right now in the starting stage, I'm focusing on building the logic of the game in bare cpp
after the functional requirements are done, then I'll think about the non functional requirements or enhancements...

for now Ill use the board to be of 4x4, imma increase it later

right now im writing the core logic of slide functionality or the base of slide functionality

I'll write it just for a single column i.e what happens in 4 adjacent cells of a column when a slide action takes place

- ok this is successfully done, Im using new temporary array then
  iterating over the row and computing, this seems fine

---

finally done with the cli functionality,
its pretty basic c++ code, but the 2 main things are working fine:

- sliding actions L,R,U,D
- new number inserted in random empty positions of the board

---

now I'll see code refactoring, leveraging c++ features,
rn my code is a mess, I have to clean it up and add do some
renovation
so i'll see online cpp projects for reference, I dont know how long this will take but Im sure the code will be good afterwards
so lets start
