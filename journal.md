right now in the starting stage, I'm focusing on building the logic of the game in bare cpp
after the functional requirements are done, then I'll think about the non functional requirements or enhancements...

for now Ill use the board to be of 4x4, imma increase it later

right now im writing the core logic of slide functionality or the base of slide functionality

I'll write it just for a single column i.e what happens in 4 adjacent cells of a column when a slide action takes place

- ok this is successfully done, Im using new temporary array then
  iterating over the row and computing, this seems fine
